	<h1>Capybara On The Loose After Overturned Truck Incident</h1>
    <h3><i>Reported By ThePeeps191</i></h3>
    <p>Yesterday morning, a zoo truck carrying a large capybara overturned on a local road. Although the driver wasn’t hurt, the capybara did escape and headed north and could be anywhere by now.</p>
    <p>A capybara is the largest rodent on earth. It looks like a furry pig and it often stays near water where it can hide and swim. “Anyone who spots the capybara should call the Monkeyland Wildlife Center immediately and keep note of their location,” says wildlife officer Dr. John Doe. The capybara is omnivorous but, when it gets desperate, it will hunt meat so it is advisable to keep your pets indoors. The capybara has a thick body and short legs. Additionally, it doesn’t have a tail and gnaws on nuts and wood. It communicates with clicks, grunts, barks, and whistles. It’s important to find the capybara because it can cause destruction in the town. If you’re a farmer, keep your eyes peeled as capybaras often graze beside goats and sheeps.</p>
    <p>The capybara, nicknamed “Rob”, is about 1 meter long. There’s an obvious blotch of fur on his butt and he hides in forests with thick vegetation. His barks sound like deep dog barks and it runs quickly like a horse.</p>
    <p>The wildlife center can be contacted through contact@monkeyland-life.meme and any sightings of the capybara should be reported to the center. For information, check the wildlife center's website for details on the case.</p>
