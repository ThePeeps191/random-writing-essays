	<h1>The Thrilling Palancar Reef</h1>
    <h3><i>Written By ThePeeps191</i></h3>
    <p>The Palancar Reef is one of the most diverse coral reefs on our planet. It is home to over thousands of ocean animal species. It is located just off the island of Cozumel near Southeastern Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. But there is more to the Palancar Reef!</p>
    <p>The reef is in Mexico. It is 3.5 miles long and its depth ranges from 50 to 115 feet. The closest way to access it is from the Palancar Beach. The Palancar Reef is also part of the Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park, so it is important to care for it and protect it.</p>
    <p>The Palancar Reef is actually a blend of several different coral formations, and it is a coral reef. Something really cool about the reef is that its waters are crystal clear, with visibility up to 200 feet. That is good for the many scuba divers that dive there because they can easily mingle with the sea turtles, eagle rays, and the tropical fish that inhabit the reef.</p>
    <p>As already mentioned, many sea animals live in the Palancar Reef. Some of these animals are humpback whales, hammerhead sharks, seahorses, butterfly fish, sea fans, green moray eels, squirrel fish, many kinds of eels, sergeant majors, bat fish, barracuda, indigenous Splendid Toad Fish, wrasse, octopus, plus a handful of other tropical fish.</p>
    <p>Sadly though, there are also many endangered species that live in the reef, such as the Hawksbill Turtle. The Hawksbill Turtle gets its name from the shape of its curved, pointed beak. The beak resembles the beak of a bird of prey, like a falcon or an eagle. They use their beaks to feed on the sponges and the many other invertebrates that grow in the Palancar Reef.</p>
    <p>One surprising fact for me was that the water is very clear. It was interesting because pollution nowadays makes a lot of reefs and bodies of water dirty and unclear. That, however, is not the case for the Palancar Reef. The water is so clear, even from the surface, that you can spot fish swimming to as much as 200 feet below you!</p>
    <p>The Palancar reef is a great place to explore, have fun, and to be with ocean animals. Someday, I wish I could go and visit the thrilling Palancar Reef.</p>
