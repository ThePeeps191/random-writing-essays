	<h1>The Fantastic Blue Grotto</h1>
    <h3><i>Written By ThePeeps191</i></h3>
    <p>The Blue Grotto is one of the most fascinating places on Earth. It is a huge cave, located on the Island of Capri, just of the city of Anacapri in Italy. Everyday, many tourists come to the giant see cave, but that is not the only reason why the cave is special.</p>
    <p>Unlike your average dark cave, the Blue Grotto is filled with a brilliant blue glow of light. This is because there is another underwater tunnel. It allows some sunlight in from the outside. This makes the rare glowing phenomenon occur!</p>
    <p>The sea cave is 60 meters long, 25 meters wide and 150 meters deep. Compared to other typical caves, it's actually not that big. Other caves are normally around 100-200 meters in length and width. The other caves are also normally about 200 meters deep.</p>
    <p>Most people don't swim in the sea cave. It's illegal and dangerous, as the waves can be very rough sometimes. That can make it easy for you to hit a body part against the limestone green walls. You might can severely injured, and there would be nobody around to rescue you. But like all things, there are always some illegal doers. These visitors will come to the Blue Grotto after 5:30 PM, because by then, the rowboats and the ticket offices would be gone.</p>
    <p>Some animals that call the Blue Grotto their natural habitat are barracudas, jacks, octopus, morays, and a handful of some other plant species.</p>
    <p>One interesting and fun fact that surprised me about the Blue Grotto sea cave was that in the ancient times, the cave was used as the personal swimming pool of the Roman Emperor Tiberius.</p>
    <p>Bright blue glowing light is just one out of the many things that make the Blue Grotto cave a fascinating tourist site. Someday, I would like to visit the Blue Grotto cave with my family.</p>
