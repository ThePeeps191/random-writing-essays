	<h1>Rafting In Fernie</h1>
    <h3><i>Written By ThePeeps191</i></h3>
    <p>Have you ever went rafting before? A couple of years ago, in August 2020, I went to Fernie with some of my friends that live in southern Calgary, and we stayed there in a house for three days.  We played at a beautiful lake, went hiking at a steep mountain, and went rafting in a wonderful river. Out of all those activities, I think rafting was the best and most amusing.</p>
	<p>Rafting was our final activity and it was on the last day of our trip. After packing all our gear and supplies into our cars, we were ready to leave.</p>
    <p>The drive’s duration was about half an hour. The trees surrounding us swayed to the breeze, and the sun burned brightly in the sky. Once we got to a spot near the river we were going to go rafting at, some people that worked for the rafting company picked us up in two sleek white vans. As we drove closer to the river, the sound of rushing water grew louder and louder.</p>
    <p>We had arrived at the extensive river, and the staff people were unloading two long rafts, plus some life vests. Our group had to split into two, as there weren’t enough seats in one raft to fit us all.</p>
    <p>The rower of our raft was a lady, in her 60s or so. Although she was older than our parents, she was still very strong. The parents in our raft chatted with her, and the day seamed very calm. I helped to propel the boat by helping to row it. Occasionally, the water would be rough and it would rock our boat. It would also sometimes be shallow, causing us to be more careful while rowing.</p>
    <p>One time, it was so bumpy that everyone on board got drenched by the waves’ splashing. We were all impressed and amazed by the river’s strength. Luckily, under the sun, it wasn’t very cold with all the water on us, not to mention that most of it was on our life vests, and not our clothes.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, when our two rafts were close together, we would try to splash each other using the oars. Most of the time, the other group’s raft was ahead of us by a few meters. We would put the oars into the water, and “push” the water out of the river. It looked a bit like rain, and when a group would successfully splash the other group, they would laugh. They smiled and made some giggling noises. Some of them also swayed back and forth in the boat. My friend Jonathan’s dad even joined the water fight. He used a big oar and got us all wet.</p>
    <p>After about half our ride, we stopped by a small island that was made of rocks. The rowers served us some brownies and lemonade. The brownies tasted very saccharine, and the lemonade was quite refreshing, especially under the scorching sun. When I finished my first brownie, I was hungry for more. The wonderful taste of the brownies made me feel very contented.</p>
    <p>Many trees surrounded the river, and rocks decorated the river’s bottom. We also learned that in Spring, the water would be way higher than it was in Summer-Fall time period. At one point, we all spotted a huge fallen tree gently and gracefully floating in the water, and realized that it had fallen due to high water levels that happened in Spring. Dirty green slimy moss covered the tree, as some of its branches had broken off and were floating beside it. Many bugs were eating away at the wood.</p>
    <p>Although helping to row the boat was quite tiring for me, it was very worth the effort. I think that the experience was both fun and enjoyable. One that I will not soon forget.</p>
