	<h1>A New Discovery</h1>
    <h3><i>Written By ThePeeps191</i></h3>
    <p>I was falling asleep after a day's work of hard duties when somebody shouted  "Land!" and everybody woke up. I quickly jumped out of bed and ran into the main hall of the ship where our lookout, Rodrigo de Triana, and Captain Columbus were waiting. I looked around and realized that half the crew had already gathered around me.</p>
    <p>"I see you have arrived quickly, Pedro," remarked Captain Columbus.</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir," I replied.</p>
    <p>After a few more minutes of waiting for the other crew members, Captain Columbus started addressing the crowd.
    <p>"Silence, everybody!", bellowed Captain Columbus.</p>
    <p>"Our lookout, Triana, has spotted land!"</p>
    <p>A murmur went through the crowd. Was this possible? Had our voyage led us to Asia at last? Were we going to get rich? We all wondered the same things but we had no answers. We needed to set foot on the new land.</p>
    <p>As the crowd dispersed, everyone started preparing our supplies which we would need if we were going to camp on the new land. I peered through my room window and noticed that there really was land! Trees dotted the landscape and from what I could notice, it was all green. I couldn’t see any people at all. As I thought about it, a new thought entered my mind. Maybe we discovered new land! I raced downstairs and watched as our ship neared the island. Our helmsman docked the ship and I hurried to help the other cabin boys unload our cargo and gear.</p>
    <p>On the island we spotted, we tried to find people that already lived there. Captain Columbus sent groups of us to explore different parts of the land. I went to the Eastern part of the land. Many funny looking animals climbed around on the trees and weird animals scurried around the ground. When all of us had gathered together again, we shared our findings. Numerous people reported finding evidence of people but no actual people themselves. One group even spotted a campsite with a rounded hut! After discussing together as a crew, we all realized something — we had discovered a new area of land!</p>
    <p>Together, we searched the area for signs of humans. We remained in our groups but we searched more thoroughly. As my group and I looked for remains of past people, the wind eerily blew and I felt my instincts telling me to go back to the place where we had found the round huts with the designs of animals on them. I told my group my plan on investigating the huts and they all agreed since we hadn’t found anything unusual. Everyone was moaning from the exhaustion of the sun beating down on us and we all groaned everytime we failed to find anything. After a moment of silence, I led everyone and we stomped up to the huts. Mud covered the ground and it looked like it had just rained a couple of days before we had reached the island. After getting to the first hut we found, we all tried to open the door. It was made of what felt like animal skins and mud so it easily opened. As we peered inside the odd hut, we gasped in excitement. Inside, many people were huddled around together and wearing animal skins. They were eating and looked scared. Small children lay on the ground and what looked like their mothers fed them and nursed them. We all tried to smile to show that we didn’t mean any harm but we were actually scared with our hearts pounding quickly and our hands sweating. We were pondering whether the strangers had any weapons and we tried not to breathe fast. The amazing and curious sight intrigued us all and we didn’t move a muscle from the sight of the islanders.</p>
    <p>After an awkward long silence, the biggest person walked towards us and spoke in a deep foriegn language. We didn’t understand it but we knew that we had found something new and big. Led by our third mate who was the leader of our group, we hastily raced back to where the Santa Maria and the two other ships were floating and excitedly told Captain Columbus about our findings. He stroked his chin as we told him about our story but when we got to the part about the people, he jumped with excitement and his eyebrows shot towards the sky. He let out a loud sharp whistle and the other crew members started hiking back from the woods. Once everyone had returned and gathered back together, the Captain told everyone about our stories and everyone was as surprised as he was when he first heard of our discoveries.</p>
    <p>Excitedly, everyone ran towards the huts. As they did so, everyone saw more and more people. There was a whole community of people here! This just further confirmed my theory that we had discovered a new place. We gathered all of the new people and it seemed that there was one main chief. There were also many dogs and the people seemed to rely on the animals to live. They ate animal meat, used animal skins for their clothes, and even used the bones of the animals for small but useful tools.</p>
    <p>Over the next couple of days, the highest authority crew members met with the new people. I just explored the island because the thought of a new discovery amazed me. For many days, I listened to the birds, watched the deer, and observed the trees and the shrubbery. I noted that there was a small creek running through the land. I, of course, also tended to the crew members' needs as a cabin boy but I also had plenty of time to enjoy nature. Birds chirped everywhere and the rustle of the wind against the small bushes was easily heard against the soft flow of the creek. I reported my finds to the first mate in charge while Captain Columbus was gone and he congratulated me on my exploration of the new island. At night, I helped get everyone’s tents set up and we camped like this for multiple weeks. Every night, the moon shone brightly against the dark purple night sky and the stars seemed to go on endlessly.</p>
    <p>Although I wished that our voyage could go one forever, it couldn’t and one day, Captain Columbus said that we would need to go home once again back to Spain to report our findings to the royal family which had originally sponsored our trip.</p>
    <p>On our trip back, I reflected on my experiences on the island. Our expedition inspired me to become a great explorer one day. The first voyage would forever be known as the famous exploration that kick-started European colonization and advanced the barriers of humans.</p>
